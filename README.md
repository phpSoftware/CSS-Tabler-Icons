CSS Tabler-Icons
================

> v1.0.0 (2020-04-09)

__Download [Tabler Icons](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons/releases) 
and run `icon.php` on e.g. localhost. 
It will read SVG icons from the folder `tabler` and build css from it.
Now you can use the `tabler.css` without the SVG Icons!__
